# Directives

In Angular, directives are a way to extend and modify the behavior of elements in the DOM.

## Attribute Directives:

`Purpose`: Attribute directives are used to change the appearance of a DOM element by manipulating its attributes.

`Usage`: They are applied as attributes of elements in the template.

`Example`: `ngClass`, `ngStyle` are common attribute directives that dynamically set the class or style of an element based on certain conditions


## Structural Directives:

`Purpose`: Structural directives are used to modify the structure of the DOM by adding or removing elements.

`Usage`: They are applied as attributes with an `asterisk (*)` in the template.

`Example`: `ngIf`, `ngFor`, and `ngSwitch` are common structural directives that conditionally add or remove elements, or repeat elements based on a collection.
